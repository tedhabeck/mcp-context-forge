Authentication Middleware for early user context extraction.

This middleware extracts user information from JWT tokens early in the request
lifecycle and stores it in request.state.user for use by other middleware
(like ObservabilityMiddleware) and route handlers.

Examples:

    >>> app.add_middleware(AuthContextMiddleware)  # doctest: +SKIP

    This function implements the session reuse pattern established in PR #3600
    to eliminate duplicate database sessions. It checks if a middleware (typically
    ObservabilityMiddleware) has already created a request-scoped session and
    reuses it. If no session exists (e.g., when observability is disabled), it
    creates a new one as a fallback.
