Hook payload policy types and utilities.

The framework provides the types and utilities for controlled payload
modification; the gateway defines the actual concrete policies.

Examples:
    >>> from mcpgateway.plugins.framework.hooks.policies import HookPayloadPolicy, apply_policy
    >>> policy = HookPayloadPolicy(writable_fields=frozenset({"name", "args"}))
    >>> sorted(policy.writable_fields)
    ['args', 'name']
"""

import logging
from typing import Any, Optional

# Third-Party

    Attributes:
        ALLOW: Accept all modifications (backwards compatible).
        DENY: Reject all modifications (strict mode).

    Examples:

        <DefaultHookPolicy.ALLOW: 'allow'>
        >>> DefaultHookPolicy.DENY.value

    Only fields listed in ``policy.writable_fields`` are accepted from

    Args:
        original: The original (or current) payload.
