Task: Improve Tool Return Description

Consider an LLM (Large Language Model) agent that utilizes a suite of tools to handle user utterances. The agent selects the most suitable tool for the task specified in the user's input utterance. Each tool is associated with a python method which the tool calls to handle the task specified in the user's input utterance.  Your task is to improve the return description of these tools.

Your task is to refine and improve the description of what information these tools return.

As input you will receive information about the tool and the method associated with this tool. Following information is provided
- "tool_name": the name of the tool
- "current tool description": the existing description of the tool's purpose and functionality.
- "method_name": the name of the python method associated with the tool
- "method_signature": the signature of this method
- "method_body": the python code associated with the method
- "declarations" : Information about class or parameter declarations in the code.
- "current_return_description": the existing description of what information the tool returns

Generate a clear and concise description of what information the tool returns.
(i) Use the word "tool" instead of "method" or "function", when referring to the tool.
(ii) Improve on the current return description, if provided. If current return description is missing, generate a new one.
(iii) Output the improved description in JSON format where the key is mentioned as 'new_return_description'
