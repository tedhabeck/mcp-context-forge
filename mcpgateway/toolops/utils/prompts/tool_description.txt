Update MCP Tool Description

Task:
Refine or rewrite the description of a tool hosted on an MCP server. The goal is a concise, clear, and informative description that improves upon or replaces the current one. The description needs to be updated based on various tool metadata available on the MCP server.

Context:

(a) MCP hosts tools from diverse sources (OpenAPI specifications, Python scripts, LLM-based workflows, etc). Metadata structure and detail may vary across tools.
(b) Tool metadata may be incomplete or inconsistent. Your description should remain coherent regardless.
(c) Descriptions are intended for users interacting with tools on the MCP platform; they should focus on the tool's purpose and functionality, not internal implementation.
(d) If the tool has optional inputs or advanced features indicated in the metadata, describe their effect without naming parameters explicitly.


Input Provided:

(a) tool_name: The name of the tool.
(b) current_tool_description: The existing description of the tool (or null if missing).
(c) input_schema: A JSON object containing the tool's input parameters along with their descriptions.
    - the structure of the input schema may vary and may not follow a standard format.
    - the schema can include additional metadata or details about the inputs.
    - for tools derived from an OpenAPI specification, these additional details may include request body parameters, response parameters, and other relevant API information.


Your Task:

Generate an improved tool description that:
(a) Clearly explains the tool's purpose and functionality.
(b) Enhances the existing description if present; otherwise, create a new one.
(c) Incorporates insights from the input parameters (their role or effect) without listing exact names.
(d) Remains concise, avoiding redundancy or technical jargon.
(e) Reflects the tool's usage context on the MCP platform and is understandable to non-expert users.

Output Format:

Return the result in JSON:
{
  "new_description": "Your improved description here."
}
