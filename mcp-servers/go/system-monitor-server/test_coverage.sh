## Overall Coverage
\`\`\`
$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -1)
\`\`\`

## Package Coverage
- **Main Package**: $(go tool cover -func=coverage/main.out | tail -1 | awk '{print $3}')
- **Config Package**: $(go tool cover -func=coverage/config.out | tail -1 | awk '{print $3}')
- **Metrics Package**: $(go tool cover -func=coverage/metrics.out | tail -1 | awk '{print $3}')
- **Monitor Package**: $(go tool cover -func=coverage/monitor.out | tail -1 | awk '{print $3}')

## Files Generated
- \`coverage.html\` - Interactive HTML coverage report
- \`coverage.txt\` - Text coverage report
- \`benchmarks.txt\` - Benchmark results
- \`race.txt\` - Race detection results
- \`verbose_tests.txt\` - Verbose test output

## Test Commands Used
\`\`\`bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=count ./...

# Generate HTML report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Generate text report
go tool cover -func=coverage.out > coverage.txt

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...

# Run race detection
go test -race ./...
\`\`\`

## Coverage Goals
- **Target**: > 80% overall coverage
- **Critical Paths**: > 90% coverage for main handlers and core logic
- **Edge Cases**: All error paths should be tested

## Notes
- Some tests may fail due to system-specific behavior (e.g., process access)
- Network-dependent tests may fail in isolated environments
- File system tests use temporary files and should clean up automatically
