"""Unit tests for main.py and observability.py coverage gaps.

This module contains targeted tests for specific uncovered lines.
Note: Lines 3150-3155 in main.py are module-level initialization code
that runs when the module is imported. These are tested via integration
tests that import the module with different environment configurations.
