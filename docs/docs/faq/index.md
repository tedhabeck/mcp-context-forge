# ContextForge MCP Gateway - Frequently Asked Questions

## ⚡ Quickstart

???+ example "🚀 How can I install and run MCP Gateway in one command?"
    PyPI (pipx / uvx makes an isolated venv):

    ```bash
    # Using pipx - pip install pipx
    pipx run mcp-contextforge-gateway

    # Or uvx - pip install uv (default: admin/changeme)
    uvx mcp-contextforge-gateway --port 4444
    ```

    OCI image (Docker/Podman) - shares host network so localhost works:

    ```bash
    podman run --network=host -p 4444:4444 ghcr.io/ibm/mcp-context-forge:0.6.0
    ```

???+ example "🗂️ What URLs are available for the admin interface and API docs?"
    - Admin UI → <https://localhost:4444>
    - Swagger → <https://localhost:4444/docs>
    - ReDoc → <https://localhost:4444/redoc>

## 🤔 What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

???+ info "💡 What is MCP in a nutshell?"
    MCP is an open-source protocol released by Anthropic in Nov 2024 that lets language models invoke external tools via a typed JSON-RPC envelope. Community folks call it "USB-C for AI"-one connector for many models.

???+ info "🌍 Who supports MCP and what's the ecosystem like?"
    - Supported by GitHub & Microsoft Copilot, AWS Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, IBM watsonx, AgentBee, LangChain, CrewAI and 15,000+ community servers.
    - Contracts enforced via JSON Schema.
    - Multiple transports (STDIO, SSE, HTTP) - still converging.

## 🛠️ Installation & Configuration

???+ example "🔧 What is the minimal .env setup required?"
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then edit:

    ```env

## 🚀 Running & Deployment

???+ example "🏠 How do I run MCP Gateway locally using PyPI?"
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install mcp-contextforge-gateway
    mcpgateway
    ```

???+ example "🐳 How do I use the provided Makefile and Docker/Podman setup?"
    ```bash
    make podman # or make docker
    make podman-run-ssl # or make docker-run-ssl
    make podman-run-ssl-host # or make docker-run-ssl-host
    ```

    Docker Compose is also available, ex: `make compose-up`.

???+ example "☁️ How can I deploy MCP Gateway on Google Cloud Run, Code Engine, Kubernetes, AWS, etc?"
    See the [Deployment Documentation](../deployment/index.md) for detailed deployment instructions across local, docker, podman, compose, AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud, Helm, Minikube, Kubernetes, OpenShift and more.

---

## 💾 Databases & Persistence

???+ info "🗄️ What databases are supported for persistence?"
    - SQLite (default) - used for development / small deployments.
    - PostgreSQL / MySQL / MariaDB via `DATABASE_URL`
    - Redis (optional) for high performance session management. Sessions can also be stored in the DB or memory.
    - Other databases supported by SQLAlchemy.

???+ info "📦 How do I persist SQLite across container restarts?"
    Include a persistent volume with your container or Kubernetes deployment. Ex:

    ```bash
    docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app ghcr.io/ibm/mcp-context-forge:0.6.0
    ```

    For production use, we recommend PostgreSQL. A Docker Compose target with PostgreSQL and Redis is provided.

---

## 🔐 Security & Auth

???+ danger "🆓 How do I disable authentication for development?"
    Set `AUTH_REQUIRED=false` - disables login for local testing.

???+ example "🔑 How do I generate and use a JWT token?"
    ```bash
    export MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN=$(python3 -m mcpgateway.utils.create_jwt_token -u admin -exp 0 --secret my-test-key)
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" https://localhost:4444/tools
    ```

    The token is used for all API interactions and can be configured to expire using `-exp`.

???+ tip "📥 How do I bulk import multiple tools at once?"
    Use the `/admin/tools/import` endpoint to import up to 200 tools in a single request:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:4444/admin/tools/import \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data-binary @tools.json
    ```

    See the [Bulk Import guide](../manage/bulk-import.md) for details on format and error handling.

???+ example "🛡️ How do I enable TLS and configure CORS?"
    - Use `make podman-run-ssl` for self-signed certs or drop your own certificate under `certs`.
    - Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` or `CORS_ENABLED` for CORS headers.

---

## 📡 Tools, Servers & Federation

???+ example "➕ How do I register a tool with the gateway?"
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \\
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
         -d '{"name":"clock_tool","url":"http://localhost:9000/rpc","input_schema":{"type":"object"}}' \\
         http://localhost:4444/tools
    ```

???+ example "🌉 How do I add a peer MCP gateway?"
    A "Gateway" is another MCP Server. The MCP Gateway itself is an MCP Server. This means you can add any MCP Server under "Gateways" and it will retrieve Tools/Resources/Prompts.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \\
         -d '{"name":"peer","url":"http://peer:4444"}' \\
         http://localhost:4444/gateways
    ```

???+ example "🖇️ What are virtual servers and how do I use them?"
    A Virtual Server is a MCP Server composed from Tools/Resources/Prompts from multiple servers. Add one or more MCP Servers under "Gateways", then select which Tools/Prompts/Resources to use to create your Virtual Server.

## 🏎️ Performance Tuning & Scaling

???+ example "⚙️ What environment variables affect performance?"
    - `TOOL_CONCURRENT_LIMIT`
    - `TOOL_RATE_LIMIT`
    - `WEBSOCKET_PING_INTERVAL`
    - `SSE_RETRY_TIMEOUT`

???+ example "🧵 How do I scale the number of worker processes?"
    - `GUNICORN_WORKERS` (for Gunicorn)
    - `UVICORN_WORKERS` (for Uvicorn)

???+ example "📊 How can I benchmark performance?"
    Use `ab` or `wrk` against `/health` to measure raw latency.
    Check out the detail performance testing harness under `tests/hey`.

## 📈 Observability & Logging

???+ example "🔍 What metrics are available?"
    - Prometheus-style `/metrics` endpoint
    - Tool/server/prompt stats via Admin UI

???+ example "📜 What log formats are supported?"
    - `LOG_FORMAT=json` or `text`
    - Adjust with `LOG_LEVEL`

---

## 🧪 Smoke Tests & Troubleshooting

???+ example "🛫 Is there a full test script I can run?"
    Yes - see `docs/basic.md`.

???+ example "🚨 What common errors should I watch for?"
    | Symptom               | Resolution                             |
    |-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
    | 401 Unauthorized      | Refresh token / check Authorization    |
    | database is locked    | Use Postgres / increase DB_POOL_SIZE   |
    | already exists errors | Use *Show inactive* toggle in UI       |
    | SSE drops every 30 s  | Raise `SSE_RETRY_TIMEOUT`              |
