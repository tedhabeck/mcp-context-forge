# ADR-0004: Combine JWT & Basic Auth

- *Status:* Accepted
- *Date:* 2025-02-01
- *Deciders:* Core Engineering Team

## Context

The gateway needs to support two types of clients:

- **Browser-based users** using the Admin UI
- **Headless clients** such as scripts, services, and tools

These use cases require different authentication workflows:

- Browsers prefer form-based login and session cookies.
- Automation prefers stateless, token-based access.

The current config exposes both:

- `BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_EXPIRY_SECONDS`, and cookie settings

## Decision

We will combine both authentication modes as follows:

- **Basic Auth** secures access to `/admin`. Upon success, a short-lived **JWT cookie** is issued.
- **JWT Bearer token** (via header or cookie) is required for all API, WebSocket, and SSE requests.
- Tokens are signed using the shared `JWT_SECRET_KEY` and include standard claims (sub, exp, scopes).
- When `AUTH_REQUIRED=false`, the gateway allows unauthenticated access (dev only).

## Consequences

- ‚úÖ Developers can log in once via browser and obtain an authenticated session.
- ‚úÖ Scripts can use a generated JWT directly, with no credential storage.
- ‚ùå Tokens must be signed, rotated, and verified securely (TLS required).
- üîÑ JWTs expire and must be refreshed periodically by clients.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| **JWT only** | CLI tools need a pre-acquired token; not friendly for interactive login. |
| **Basic only** | Password sent on every request; cannot easily revoke or expire credentials. |
| **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect** | Too complex for self-hosted setups; requires external identity provider. |
| **mTLS client auth** | Secure but heavy; not usable in browsers or simple HTTP clients. |

## Status

This combined authentication mechanism is implemented and enabled by default in the gateway.

## Update: Asymmetric JWT Algorithm Support

- *Date:* 2025-01-13
- *Status:* Extended
- *Enhancement By:* Core Engineering Team

### Enhancement Overview

JWT authentication has been extended to support both symmetric (HMAC) and asymmetric (RSA/ECDSA) algorithms, significantly expanding the gateway's authentication capabilities for enterprise and distributed environments.

### Supported Algorithms

| Category | Algorithms | Use Case | Key Management |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **HMAC (Symmetric)** | HS256, HS384, HS512 | Single-service, simple deployments | Shared secret (`JWT_SECRET_KEY`) |
| **RSA (Asymmetric)** | RS256, RS384, RS512 | Multi-service, enterprise | Public/private key pair |
| **ECDSA (Asymmetric)** | ES256, ES384, ES512 | High-performance, modern crypto | Public/private key pair |

### Configuration

**Symmetric (HMAC) - Default:**
```bash
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

**Asymmetric (RSA/ECDSA) - New:**
```bash
JWT_ALGORITHM=RS256
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=jwt/public.pem
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=jwt/private.pem
JWT_AUDIENCE_VERIFICATION=true
```

### Benefits of Asymmetric Support

‚úÖ **Enhanced Security**

- Private key never leaves the signing service
- Public key can be safely distributed for verification
- Eliminates shared secret management challenges

‚úÖ **Scalability & Federation**

- Multiple services can verify tokens independently
- No need to distribute signing secrets
- Supports microservices and distributed architectures

‚úÖ **Enterprise Compliance**

- Meets enterprise security standards (SOC2, ISO 27001)
- Supports Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- Enables proper key lifecycle management

‚úÖ **Future-Proof Architecture**

- Foundation for advanced features like key rotation
- Compatible with industry-standard JWT libraries
- Supports Dynamic Client Registration scenarios

### Implementation Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing HMAC configurations continue to work unchanged
- **Runtime Configuration**: Algorithm and keys are validated at startup
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for misconfigured keys or missing files
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead for asymmetric operations in typical workloads

### Security Considerations

- **Key Storage**: Private keys must be secured and never committed to version control
- **Key Rotation**: Implement regular key rotation procedures for asymmetric keys
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose algorithm based on security requirements and performance needs
- **Audience Verification**: Can be disabled for Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) scenarios
