# Admin Console Concepts

> This guide introduces each major section of the Gateway Admin UI and how it connects to the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 🆕 Setting up a new MCP Server to federate to the gateway

???+ example "🔌 How do I expose an MCP server over SSE?"
    To federate a new MCP Server to your gateway, it must run over **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** so the gateway can communicate with it.

    Use the built-in translate bridge to wrap any `stdio`-only MCP server and expose it over SSE:

    ```bash
    python3 -m mcpgateway.translate --stdio "uvx mcp-server-git" --expose-sse --port 8001
    python3 -m mcpgateway.translate --stdio "uvx mcp_server_time -- --local-timezone=Europe/Dublin" --expose-sse --port 8002
    ```

    ✅ **Important:** The gateway must be able to reach the MCP server's network address.

    If you're running services inside Docker (or other containerized environments), ensure networking is configured properly:

    - Use `host` networking when needed.
    - Expose ports to the host machine.
    - Make sure internal container IPs are reachable from the gateway.


## 📦 Virtual Servers

> A virtual server is a logical wrapper that combines selected tools, resources, and prompts under one context-specific endpoint.

???+ info "🔗 What are Virtual Servers?"

    - A Virtual Server defines a project-specific toolset.
    - Each one is backed by a real SSE or STDIO interface.
    - You can activate/deactivate, view metrics, and invoke tools from this server.

## 🛠 Global Tools

> Tools are remote functions that an LLM can invoke, either via MCP or REST. Think of them like typed APIs with schemas and optional auth.

???+ example "⚙️ What do Tools represent?"

    - Integration Types: `MCP`, `REST`
    - Request Types: `STDIO`, `SSE`, `GET`, `POST`, etc.
    - Input Schema: JSON Schema defines valid input.
    - Supports Basic Auth, Bearer, or Custom headers.

## 📁 Global Resources

> Resources expose read-only data like files, database rows, logs, or screenshots. LLMs can read this content through a URI.

???+ example "📖 How do Resources work?"

    - Text and Binary data supported.
    - Exposed via unique URI (`file:///`, `db://`, etc.).
    - Resources can be listed, templated, or subscribed to.

## 🧾 Global Prompts

> Prompts are reusable message templates with arguments. They define system prompts, user instructions, or chainable inputs.

???+ info "🗒 What's in a Prompt?"

    - Each prompt has a name, template, and arguments.
    - Arguments are defined with name, description, and required status.
    - Used to enforce consistency across tool use or system messaging.

## 🌐 Gateways (MCP Servers)

> Gateways are other MCP-compatible servers. When registered, their tools/resources/prompts become usable locally.

???+ example "🌉 What is a federated Gateway?"

    - Syncs public tools from a remote MCP server.
    - Peer tools show up in your catalog with `gateway_id`.
    - Can be toggled active/inactive.

## 📂 Roots

> Roots define base folders for file-based resources. They control what files MCP clients can access from your local system.

???+ tip "📁 What are Roots used for?"

    - Restrict access to specific folders (`file:///workspace`)
    - Prevent tools from referencing outside their sandbox.
    - Deleting a root invalidates its associated resources.

---

## 📈 Metrics

> Track tool calls, resource reads, prompt renders, and overall usage in one place.

???+ info "📊 What does the Metrics tab show?"

    - Overall executions by server/tool/prompt.
    - Latency, failure rate, and hot paths.
    - Top tools, resources, prompts, and servers.

    <!-- ![Metrics GIF](./images/metrics.gif) -->

---

## 🧪 Version & Diagnostics

> The `/version` endpoint returns structured JSON diagnostics including system info, DB/Redis health, and Git SHA.

???+ example "🩺 What does the Version panel include?"

    - MCP protocol version and server metadata.
    - Live system metrics (CPU, memory).
    - Environment checks and service readiness.
